In our current world newly introduced to the power of big data, one could observe that we are in a kind of middle ground. As a society we have access to never before seen computational power and methods of data collection. However, we are still so far away from generally being able to gather statistics on entire populations. As it stands, it is virtually impossible to gather fully comprehensive data on the global population, or even on nations. 
It is because of these current limitations that we must rely on statistical analysis rather than parameter analysis. Statistics describe data from a sample taken from an entire population. Samples are best when taken at random in order to make the best attempt at describing the population in an unbiased way. When taking a sample from the population we are able to conduct statistical analysis such as deriving the mean or standard deviation of the sample, which we hope is identical to the mean and standard deviation of the population. We can also observe the densities of various occurrences within a sample, in other words the probability of observing a particular value within a sample. When analyzing these probabilities, one of the most important concepts to consider is the Normal Distribution.
The Normal Distribution, also known as the bell-curve or normal curve describes the tendency of data to cluster around a central value, this central value being the population mean. Therefore, for any normal distribution, one would observe that some data will be observed below the mean, while an equal amount of data are observed above the mean, most being located close to the mean. To be more precise, 68.27% of the data points are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95.45% are within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.73% are within 3 standard deviations of the mean, as visualized below:
 
The Normal Distribution is a quite natural phenomenon being found in samples of blood pressure, height, and weight among people. We can observe the normal distribution so often as it is the representation of averages of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions. To give an example, one can take a closer look at height. Height is a measure of a person, this measure being the result of a culmination of other factors at play, such as genetics, geography, diet, exercise and lifestyle choice. The random distribution of these factors among individuals within a population leads to the observation of a normal distribution within the samples observed.
